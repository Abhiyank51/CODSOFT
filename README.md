![Titanic Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)

This repository contains a Python project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Using various machine learning techniques, we analyze the Titanic dataset to build and evaluate models that predict whether a passenger survived the disaster.

## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 lost their lives. This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build machine learning models that predict the survival of passengers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes information on passenger demographics, ticket class, port of embarkation, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodSoft-Titanic Survival Prediction.git
    cd titanic-survival-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) are in the `data/` directory. You can download them from the [Kaggle Titanic competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore and run the code:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open `Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells to train models and make predictions.

## Modeling Process

The modeling process includes the following steps:

1. Data Exploration: Understanding the data and identifying missing values.
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and transforming features.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones.
4. Model Training: Training various machine learning models.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.
6. Prediction: Making predictions on the test set.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. The confusion matrix and ROC curve are included in the Jupyter notebook for further evaluation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
